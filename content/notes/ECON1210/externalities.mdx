title: Externalities

## Introduction

!!! note "Externalities"

    **Market failure** is a situation where there is **inefficient allocation of goods** in the **free market**. 

    Free market is the best, as **social welfare is maximized**. Any distortion, such as taxes, subsidies and price controls will cause **welfare loss**. 

    Important assumptions behind these results:
    * When all production costs are the responsibility of suppliers
    * When all consumption benefits are given to buyers

    **Externalities** are the **external costs or benefits** that doesn't directly accure to buyers or sellers involved.

    !!! eg "Example externalities"
    
        * **Negative externalities**: Pollution, traffic congestion, noise
        * **Positive externalities**: Education, vaccination, R&D

!!! note "Private, external, social cost and benefit"

    * **Private** is directly incurred by the buyer or seller
    * **External** is incurred by a third party
    * **Social** is incurred by the society as a whole: $SX=PX+EX, X \in \{C,B\}$

!!! tip "Social optimality: Decision by margin"

    ***Recall**: we should make decision to maximize TES:*
    ***Recall**: $MB$ and $MC$ can be directly interpreted as the demand and supply curve. 
    

    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{(private) Market equilibrium: } MB & = MC (D = S)\\
    MSB & = MB + EB = D + EB\\
    MSC & = MC + EC = S + EC\\
    \text{Social equilibrium: } MSB & = MSC\\
    \end{aligned}
    ```

    Where $MSB$ is the marginal social benefit (demand) and $MSC$ is the marginal social cost (supply).

!!! info "Total economic surplus to the society"

    Under externalities, the TES is given by:

    ```math
    TES = \text{Area under} MSB - \text{Area under} MSC
    ```

    Note that this can give rise to negative TES, unlike the private case.

!!! info "Deadweight loss when making private decisions"

    Notice that $MSB, MSC$ is due to a upwards shift of $D$ and $S$ curves respectively. 

    The **deadweight loss** (for making private decisions) is the triangle formed by shifting the curve up, with respect to the equilibrium point. 

## Achieving social optimality

We can let the market solve the problem itself, or have the government intervene. 

Implementing tax and subsidies are costly for the government to implement (requires cost to gather info). 

If we know value of externalities $\to$ use **pigouvian taxes/subsidies**.
If we know social optimal output $\to$ use **tradable permits**.

!!! note "Property rights"
    
    Legal rules stating what people or firms may do with their property.

!!! tip "Coase theorem"

    Eventual market outcome is the **social optimal outcome** if property rights are well defined and **negotiation cost is zero** (transaction cost), **regardless** of the **initial allocation of property rights**

    <BlockSep />

    Transaction costs are the cost of making an exchange (deal). It is **propto the number of parties involved**.

    Property rights does not affect **efficiency** of outcome, but affects **distribution** of welfare.

!!! tip "Pigouvian taxes and subsidies"

    We can help achieve the social optimal outcome by providing a tax or subsidy the same as the externality:

    ```math
    ts = E
    ```

    Note that $E$ should be negative if it is a cost (tax), and positive if it is a benefit (subsidy).

title: Power of Trade and Comparative Advantage

NOTE: INCOMPLETE. UPDATE WHEN REVIEW.

## Advantages

!!! info "Absolute advantage"

    The cost required for production for any given good is lower than that of another producer.

!!! tip "Comparative advantage"

    A producer has a comparative advantage in producing a good if the **opportunity cost** of producing that good is **lower** than that of another producer.

    Consider goods $G_1,G_2$, which takes costs $C$ to produce, or can be produced $U$ units in a period of time. The opportunity cost comparatively *of producing G* is given by:

    ```math
    OC_{G_1} = \frac{C_1}{C_2} = \frac{U_2}{U_1},\quad(G_2\text{ per }G_1)
    ```

!!! tip "Terms of trade (TOT)"

    The ratio at which one good can be exchanged for another, which determines the gains of each producer.

    ```math
    TOT = n
    ```

    ```math
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Gain from trade for producer of 1} &= C_1 - TOT^{-1} \cdot C_2\\
        
        \text{Gain from trade for producer of 2} &= C_2 - TOT \cdot C_1\\
    \end{align*}
    ```

    The admissible $TOT$ is the range of values that trade will occur in: $TOT\in \{\min\{OC\},\max\{OC\}\}$

    Note as TOT and OC are ratios, make sure they refer to the same good per unit.

!!! tip "Specialisation"

    Specialisation is the act of producing only one good, which can be done when a producer has a comparative advantage in producing that good.

## Production possibilities

!!! tip "Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) - Individual"

    A plot of $G_1-G_2$ where $G_1$ is the quantity of Good 1 produced and $G_2$ is the quantity of Good 2 produced for a single producer.

    Any points **inside** the curve are **inefficient** and any points **outside** the curve are **unattainable**. Points on the curve are **efficient**.

    A PPC can be represented as:
    ```math
    G_1 = (-OC_2) \cdot G_2 + c
    ```

    Where $OC_2$ (slope) is the opportunity cost of producing Good 2 and $c$ (y-intercept) the quantity of Good 1 produced when no Good 2 is produced.

    <BlockSep />

    Use the $PPC$ formula to find the amount of goods produced given amount of the other good by substitution.

    To find the amount of goods produced, given a **proportion constraint** $p=G_1:G_2$, plot $G_1 = p\cdot G_2$ and find the **intersection** with the PPC.

!!! tip "PPC of many producers"

    To construct the PPC of multiple producers, we **arrange the curves from lowest to highest opportunity cost (slope)** and connect each ends.

    The curve will be **concave** due to the **increasing opportunity cost** of producing more of a good.

!!! note "Economic growth"

    Economic growth is represented by an **outward shift** of the PPC.

    Some factors that can cause this are:
    1. Increase in productive resources (e.g. labour, capital)
    2. Improvement in technology & education

## World trade

!!! note "World Terms of Trade"

    The world terms of trade can be given by the price of goods, or a ratio.

!!! info "Consumption Possibilities Curve (CPC)"

    In a closed economy, $CPC = PPC$ as the economy can only consume what it produces.

    In an open economy, $CPC > PPC$ as the economy can consume what it produces and what it imports.

    Given a world economy of \$$p_1$ for $G_1$ and \$$p_2$ for $G_2$, find the CPC by:
    1. Find income by iterating through intersection points of PPCs and axes. Income is given by $I_i = p_1 G_{1i} + p_2 G_{2i}$
    2. Choose highest income $I$
    3. $CPC : G_1 = -\frac{p_2}{p_1} \cdot G_2 + I$

    <BlockSep />

    Use the $CPC$ formula to find the amount of goods consumed given amount of the other good by substitution in an open economy.

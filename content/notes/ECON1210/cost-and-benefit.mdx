title: Cost and Benefit
---

When taking an action $n$, benefit is your **gain**, and cost is your **loss** by choosing that action. We *ignore* all costs that are not related to choosing the action.

If there is X amount of money taht one is **willing to pay** for an action, it goes towards the **benefit** of that action.

!!! tip "Economic surplus and opportunity cost"

    Economic surplus, or net benefit, for taking an action $n$ is given by: 
    
    ```math
    ES(n) = TB(n) - TC(n),\quad T=\text{total}
    ```

    **Opportunity cost** is the cost of choosing one action $n$ over another ($n_2$):

    ```math
    OC(n) = C(n) + ES(n_2)
    ```

!!! note "Sunk cost"

    The cost that has already been incurred and **cannot be recovered**.

    **Ignore sunk cost when making decisions**, always look forward.

!!! info "Decision by margin"

    Marginal benefit/cost ($MB,MC$) means **additional** gain/loss from taking one more unit of action $n$.

    $MX(n) = TX(n) - TX(n-1),\quad X\in\{B,C\}$, for integer $n$

    If the unit of action is continous, the value $MX$ will be given, or use the derivative: $MX(n) = \frac{dTX}{dn}$.

    Net margin: $NM(n) = MB(n) - MC(n)$

!!! info "Cost-benefit principle"

    A rational person:
    - Only take action when $ES \geq 0$
    - **Only keep taking action when $NM \geq 0$**
    - **Best action is when $ES$ is maximized:** $ES_1(n) \geq ES_2(n)$

    We can make decisions about finding the **optimal** number of units to take between two or more actions by **equalizing** the net margins. 

    !!! eg "2023 Summer Midterm Q3"

        To allocate 29 hours of tasks between A & B to minimize cost, whose costs are:

        | Cost   | Formula            |
        |--------|--------------------|
        | avg. A | $AC(n) = 330 + 1.5n$ | 
        | mar. A | $MC(n) = 330 + 3n$ | 
        | avg. B | $AC(m) = 270 + 2.5m$ |
        | mar. B | $MC(m) = 270 + 5m$ |

        We need to find $n$ and $m$ such that $n + m = 29$ and the marginal costs are equalized, i.e., $MC_A(n) = MC_B(m)$. This is due to the cost-benefit principle: equalizing the net margins.
        
        ```math
        \begin{align*}
        MC_A(n) &= MC_B(m) \\
        330 + 3n &= 270 + 5m \\
        3n - 5m &= -60,\quad\text{substitute $n = 29 - m$} \\
        3(29 - m) - 5m &= -60 \\
        m = 18.375&,\quad n = 10.625
        \end{align*}
        ```

    !!! eg "Example: Workers"

        To allocate 4 workers fix items in places A & B, where the number of items repaired:
        | n. workers | fixed A | fixed B |
        |---|---|---|
        |1|70|40|
        |2|80|60|
        |3|89|79|
        |4|98|97|

        First convert the benefit table to marginal benefit table:
        | n. workers | fixed A | fixed B |
        |---|---|---|
        |1|70|40|
        |2|10|20|
        |3|9|19|
        |4|9|18|

        Then, we simply decide where workers go by choosing highest marginal benefit:

        $70\rightarrow 40\rightarrow 20\rightarrow 19\implies n_A = 1, n_B = 3$

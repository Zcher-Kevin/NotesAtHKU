## 2020 Spring Midterm Q18-19

The demand for aluminum (tons per day) by Ali Motor and Baba Motor are given by the following equations:

Ali: $Q_A = 500 - 1.7P$

Baba: $Q_B = 1300 - 0.2P$

At the price of 50 dollars per ton, the total quantity demanded for aluminum is \[A1\]

Assume the market demand for aluminum from the previous question. At the price of 50 dollars per ton, the consumer surplus in this market is \[A2\]

<Collapsible title="Solution">

Plot P-Q graph. Find intersection with $P=50$ to find $Q_{total}$.

Consumer surplus: sum of area under curve and above price line.

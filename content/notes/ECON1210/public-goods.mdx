!!! note "Classification of goods"

    We classify goods based on two properties:

    1. Rivalry - Consumption $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Availability $\downarrow$
    2. Excludability - If producers can prevent consumption of good unless paid for

    | \ | Excludable | Non-excludable |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Rival** | Private goods | Common resources |
    | **Non-rival** | Club goods | Public goods |

    Notes:

    - Private goods can be efficiency provided in competitive markets
    - It may be more efficient for gov to provide **public goods** because:
        - Brings the greatest benefits to society, 
        - More difficult to exclude non-payers from using the good

    !!! eg "Examples"

        | \ | Excludable | Non-excludable |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | **Rival** | Food, clothing, cars | Fish in the ocean |
        | **Non-rival** | Netflix, satellite TV | Air, National defence |

!!! note "Tradegy of the commons"

    Individuals have no incentive to conserve common resources, leading to overconsumption and depletion of the resource. This is known as the tragedy of the commons.

!!! info "Derive MSB curve from MB curves"

    Unlike the [market demand curve](supply-and-demand/#market-demand-curve), the **marginal social benefit (MSB)** curve is not the horizontal aggregation of individual demand curves. Instead, it is the vertical summation of individual demand curves.

    ```math
    P_{MSB} = P_{d1} + P_{d2} + \cdots
    ```

!!! info "Per unit tax and subsidies"

    A per unit tax \$t is a tax of \$t per unit of output. A per unit subsidy \$s is a subsidy of \$s per unit of output. Consider the quantity $ts=s-t$.

    The demand curve will be shifted vertically by $ts$ units, and the supply curve will be shifted vertically by $-ts$ units.

!!! tip "Wedge approach"

    Consider the new equilibrium point $(Q^*, P^*)$. Let the **wedge** be $x=Q^*$. $P_\text{Consumer}$ is the intersection of wedge and demand curve, and $P_\text{Producer}$ is the intersection of wedge and supply curve.

    ```math
    |ts| = |P_C - P_P|
    ```

    The per unit share of tax burden / subsidy benefit can be found by $|P_D-P^*|$ and $|P^*-P_S|$. 
    
!!! tip "Revenue, cost and burden"

    The government revenue from tax / cost of subsidy is $|ts| Q^*$. Inside the rectangle *in the case of tax*, the upper portion is the **consumer burden / benefit** (CB), and the lower portion is the **producer burden / benefit** (PB). It is **reversed** in the case of subsidy.

    The **less price elastic side** of the market bears **more burden** of the tax / subsidy. If elasticity is unchanged, the **ratio of burden remains unchanged** even if $ts$ changes.

!!! tip "Deadweight loss / gain"

    The **lost economic surplus** when the *socially optimal quantity* of a good is not produced, given by:

    ```math
    DWL = \frac{1}{2} \times ts \times (Q^* - Q_e) \propto \eta_s, \eta_d
    ```

    Where $Q_e$ is the equilibrium quantity without tax / subsidy, and $\eta$ is the elasticity of demand or supply.

    To find the "total economic surplus to the society corresponding to a subsidy", we can use the formula:

    ```math
    \textbf{TES corresponding to ts} = \textbf{TES before ts} - \textbf{DWL}
    ```

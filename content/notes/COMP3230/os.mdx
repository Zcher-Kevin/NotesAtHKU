!!! note "Operating system"
    
    A resource manager that manage & coordinate the use of resources amongst users, and it also provides an abstractive view on the computer to user


### COre functions 

1. Resource manager

    - Managing resources - CPUs, memory, disk, files ...
    - Decides between conflicting requests for _efficient_ and _fair use_ of resources

2. **Interface** between applications and hardware

    - Separates applications from the hardware they access
    - Provides the APIs for programs to ask for OS services 

### Core Services Allow

1. applications to run on the system ( easily, correctly, and effectively )

2. running applications to use memory as well as share the memory

3. running applications to interact with each other

4. applications to access and share data that stored in persistent storage

### Key Components

!!! info "Virtualization" 

    Make each application believe it has each resource to itself

    !!! eg "Example"

        CPU, Memory ...
        
!!! info "Concurrency"

    Events are occurring simultaneously and may interact with one another

    As a concurrent program $\rightarrow$ many internal kernel data structures may be updated concurrently by multiple execution logics
    
    **Multi-core Systems** and **multi-threaded programs** are common, in order to work correctly, they need to :
        
    - carefully access shared data, with the uses of proper synchronization primitives

!!! info "Persistence"

    Access information permanently

    !!! eg "Example"

        File system, hard drive ...


!!! note "File management"
    - **File system** : The OS component responsible for managing storage disks.
        - Stores user-created data reliably and efficiently.
        - Provides a uniform, logical view of information storage.

    - **File** : An abstraction of physical storage into a logical unit.
        - Maps files to physical media.
        - Provides mechanisms for applications to manage and access files.

!!! info "Design Goals of an OS"
    1. Ease of Use: Simplifies system interaction through abstraction.
    2. Protection: Isolates applications from each other and the OS.
    3. Efficiency: Optimizes resource utilization.
    4. Hardware Compatibility: Operates on various hardware configurations.
    5. Reliability: Prevents failures due to isolated application or hardware errors.
    6. Security: Protects resources from unauthorized access.
    7. Additional Goals: Energy efficiency, mobility, and more.

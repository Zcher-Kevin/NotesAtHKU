## Single variable linear regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 

!!! tip "Dependent and independent variables"

    - **Dependent variable**: The variable we are trying to predict (y)
    - **Independent variable**: The variable we are using to make predictions (x)

!!! tip "Simple regression model"

    The population model of y with one **independent** variable x is given by:

    ```math
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
    ```

    where:
    - $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept
    - $\beta_1$ is the slope

    we can express the model as a regression function:

    ```math
    E[y|x] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
    ```

    where $E[y|x]$ is the expected value of y given x. From the *straight-line* formula, $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept and $\beta_1$ is the slope of the line.

!!! tip "Estimated regression function"

    Estimates the regression model with n observations $(x_i, y_i)$

    ```math
    \hat{y} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} x
    ```

    where:
    - $\hat{\beta_0}$ is the estimated y-intercept
    - $\hat{\beta_1}$ is the estimated slope

!!! info "Residuals"

    The difference between the observed value of the dependent variable and the predicted value.

    ```math
    e_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}
    ```

!!! note "Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)"

    ```math
    SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
    ```

!!! note "Total Sum of Squares (SST)"

    ```math
    SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2
    ```

    where:
    - $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the dependent variable

!!! tip "Coefficient of Determination (R square)"

    The coefficient of determination $R^2$, ranged from $0\to1$ is gives the **proportion of the variance in y** that is explained by the regression model: 

    ```math
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST}
    ```

    where:
    - SSR is the sum of squared residuals
    - SST is the total sum of squares

## Multi-variable linear regression

!!! tip "Multiple regression model"

    The population model of y with k independent variables is given by:

    ```math
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_k x_k
    ```

    where:
    - $y$ is the dependent variable
    - $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$ are the independent variables
    - $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept
    - $\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_k$ are the slopes

!!! note "Multicollinearity"

    We would want IVs to be uncorrelated with each other, but in the real world, they are often **collinear**. If the correlations are too large, then estimated coefficients will be **unreliable**. This is called **multicollinearity**.

!!! info "Variance inflation factors"

    Checks for multicollinearity, of an IV. Use `vif(model)`. If value $< 10$ no problem, else drop variable.

!!! info "Adjusted R square"

    Modified version of $R^2$ that adjusts for the number of IVs. (Produced in `summary(model)`)

## Making predictions

!!! info "In-sample and out-of-sample R square"

    - **In-sample R square**: The proportion of variance explained by the model on the training data.
    - **Out-of-sample R square**: The proportion of variance explained by the model on the test data. The value can be negative, indicating that the model is worse than a simple mean prediction.

## Linear regression in R-lang

Below is an example of performing linear regression in R:

```
Call:
lm(formula = Air_quality ~ Wind + Temp, data = data)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-41.251  -13.695  -2.856   11.390  100.367 

Coefficients:
              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)  -71.0332    23.5780  -3.013  0.0032 ** 
Wind          -3.0555     0.6633  -4.607  0.00001 ***
Temp           1.8402     0.2500   7.362  0.00000 ***
---
Signif. codes:  
0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 21.85 on 113 degrees of freedom
  (37 observations deleted due to missingness)
Multiple R-squared:  0.5687,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.5611 
F-statistic: 74.5 on 2 and 113 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

!!! note "Intepreting the estimates"

    The model can be expressed as:

    ```math
    \text{Air quality} = -71.0332 - 3.0555 \text{Wind} + 1.8402 \text{Temp}
    ```

    Hence, for example if `Temp` increases by 2, the `Air_quality` will increase by `1.8402 * 2 = 3.6804`, all else being equal.

!!! note "F-test"

    The F-test is used to test the overall significance of the regression model. It tests whether at least one of the independent variables is significantly related to the dependent variable.

    The null and alt hypothesis of the F-test is :

    ```math
    H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0\\
    H_1: \exists i \in \{1,2\} \to \beta_i \neq 0
    ```

    As the `p-value` is less than `0.05`, we reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that at least one of the independent variables is significant.

!!! note "Multiple R-squared"

    The proportion of variation explained by the model, as a percentage.

!!! note "t-value"

    The t-value is computed as `Estimate / Std. Error`. 

!!! note "Significant codes"

    The signficant code is computed by comparing the p-value (`Pr(>|t|)`), and checking if it is **less than** the following values:

    - `***`: 0.001
    - `**`: 0.01
    - $\ldots$ `*`: 0.05 `.`: 0.1 ` `: 1

### Other functions

!!! note "Dimension of data"

    ```R
    > dim(data)
    [1] 151  3
    ```

    `rows columns`. The number of rows is the number of observations, and the number of columns is the number of variables.

## Difference in differences

Correlation does not mean causation. We use DiD to estimate the **casual effect** (causation) from a **treatment** (intervention).

!!! tip "DiD"
    The DiD estimator is calculated as:

    ```math
    DiD = \Delta {T} - \Delta {C}
    ```

    T is the treatment group and C is the control group. 

    !!! eg "Example"

        The treatment group is the group that receives the treatment, and the control group is the group that does not receive the treatment.

        | | Time Period      | Control Group (Sales) [C] | Treated Group (Sales) [T] |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | Before implementation | Year 1  | 1500 | 1400 | 
        | After implementation  | Year 2 | 990  | 1000 | 
        | Change [$\Delta$] | | -510 | -400 |

        Compute DiD: $DiD = \Delta T - \Delta C -400 - (-510) = 110$

!!! tip "DiD by linear regression"

    Using linear regression:

    ```math
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 P + \beta_3 (T * P)
    ```

    where:
    - $T$ is the treatment group (1 if treated, 0 if not)
    - $P$ is the post-treatment period (1 if post, 0 if pre)
    - $T * P$ is the interaction term (1 if treated AND post, 0 otherwise)

    - $\beta_0 = E[y | T=0, P=0]$ (control group pre-treatment)
    - $\beta_1 = E[y | T=1, P=0] - E[y | T=0, P=0]$ (treatment group pre-treatment)
    - $\beta_2 = E[y | T=0, P=1] - E[y | T=0, P=0]$ (control group post-treatment)
    - $\beta_3 = E[y | T=1, P=1] - E[y | T=0, P=1] - E[y | T=1, P=0] + E[y | T=0, P=0]$ (DiD)

    !!! eg "Example"
    
        ...
        
!!! info "Requirements for DiDs"

    1. Both "pre" and "post" periods must be observed for both treatment and control groups.
    2. Must have control and treated group, where the control should exhibit **parallel trend** before treatment

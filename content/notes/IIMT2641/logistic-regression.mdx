## Introduction

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the outcome variable is categorical and can take on two possible values (e.g., success/failure, yes/no, 1/0). It models the relationship between one or more independent variables and the probability of the dependent variable being in a particular category.

!!! tip "Logistic regression model"

    The outcome of a logistic regression model is $P(Y=1|X)$, which is the probability of the dependent variable being 1 given the independent variables $X$.

    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Odds} & = \frac{P(Y=1|X)}{P(Y=0|X)} \\
    \text{Logit} & = \ln\left(\frac{P(Y=1|X)}{P(Y=0|X)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X \\
    P(Y=1|X) & = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\text{Logit}}}
    \end{aligned}
    ```

    For each unit increase in $X$, logit increases by $\beta_1$.

    !!! eg "Example"

        Suppose $\beta_0 = -1.5, \beta_1 = 3, \beta_2 = -0.5$, and we have observations of independent variables $x_1=1,x_2=5$:
        
        ```math
        \begin{aligned}
        \text{Logit} & = -1.5 + 3(1) - 0.5(5) = -1.5 + 3 - 2.5 = -1\\
        \text{Odds} & = e^{-1} \\
        P(Y=1) & = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(-1)}} = \frac{1}{1 + e}\\
        \end{aligned}
        ```
    
## Making predictions

!!! info "Threshold"

    The threshold $t$ is a probability at which we classify the outcome as 1 or 0. 
    * If $P(Y=1|X) \geq t$, we classify the outcome as 1.
    * If $P(Y=1|X) < t$, we classify the outcome as 0.

!!! tip "Confusion matrix"

    A confusion / classification matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted and actual values.
    | Actual \ Predicted | 0 | 1 |
    | :---: | :---: | :---: |
    | 0 | True Negative (TN) | False Positive (FP) |
    | 1 | False Negative (FN) | True Positive (TP) |
    | When $t \Uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ | $\downarrow$ |

    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Accuracy} & = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \\
    \text{TPR True positive rate (sensitivity)} & = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \propto \frac{1}{t}\\
    \text{TNR True negative rate (specificity)} & = \frac{TN}{TN + FP} \propto \frac{1}{t} \\
    \end{aligned}
    ```

    Note: If the confusion matrix is about a prediction, the accuracy is the *out-of-sample accuracy*.

!!! info "ROC curve"

    The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of *true positive rate* against *false positive rate* at values of $t$. The plot always starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(1,1)$. 
    
    The ideal ROC curve is for it to be **close to top left corner** $(0,1)$, which means $\Uparrow TPR, \Downarrow FPR$.

    The area under the ROC curve (**AUC**) is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between two outcomes, ranges between $0$ to $1$ (perfect classifier). $AUC=0.5$ means the model is no better than random guessing.

## Logistic regression in R-lang


Below is an example of performing logistic regression in R:

```R
Call:
glm(formula = Bad_air ~ Wind + Temp, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = data)

Coefficients:
             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
(Intercept) -38.7142    10.7966  -3.586  0.000336 ***
Wind         -0.5668     0.1833  -3.092  0.001986 ** 
Temp          0.5140     0.1348   3.813  0.000137 ***

Signif. codes:  
0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

(Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)

Null deviance: 134.675  on 115  degrees of freedom
Residual deviance:  40.502  on 113  degrees of freedom
(37 observations deleted due to missingness)
AIC: 46.502
```

!!! note "Intepreting the estimates"

    The model can be expressed as:

    ```math
    \text{Logit} = -38.7142 - 0.5668 \text{Wind} + 0.5140 \text{Temp}
    ```
    
    And recall $P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\text{Logit}}}$, we can compute the probability of `Bad_air` given `Wind` and `Temp`.

!!! note "z-value"

    The z-value is computed as `Estimate / Std. Error`. 

!!! note "p-value"

    The p-value is computed as $2(1 - \phi(|z|))$. The value of $\phi$ can be found by referencing the standard normal distribution table.

[Significant codes](linear-regression/#significant-codes) are the same as in linear regression.

Showing the [confusion matrix](#confusion-matrix) in R:

```R
> table(data$Bad_air, predict(model, type = "response") >= 0.5)

  FALSE TRUE
0   85     0
1   14    17
```

The used threshold is $t=0.5$. This means, if given a predicted probability of `Bad_air` as `0.7`, we classify it as `1` (bad air).

The values in the confusion matrix are:
```
TP = 17
TN = 85
FP = 0
FN = 14
```

!!! note "First modern computer: IAS Machine"

    The IAS machine is the first modern computer, developed by von Neumann.

    It is the first general purpose computer that is **programmable**, utilizing the concept of *stored progras*.

## Milestone in computer architecture

The following technological milestones improve the typical _operations per second_ of a computer:

1. **Vacuum tubes**
2. **Transistors**
   Smaller faster and cheapter, but more expensive for commerical use and requires frequent cooling
3. **Integrated circuits**
   Supports high-level programming languages, compared to traditional punch card
4. **Very Large Scale Integration IC (VLSI)**
   Popularized high performance, personal computing

!!! note "Moore's Law"

    Moore's Law states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.

!!! note "Benchmark performance"

    Measures the $f$ **cycle per second** (Hz), also known as **clock rate**.

    |Operation|Load|Store|Branch|Jump|
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    |$CPI$|5|4|3|3|

    Average cycles per instructions: $CPI = \frac{\sum_{i}CPI_{i}\times I_{i}}{\sum_{i}I_{i}},\quad I_i = \text{Instruction count}$

    Processor time: $T=\frac{I_c\times CPI}f$

    Instructions per second: $IPS=\frac{f}{CPI}$

    MFLOPS: Million floating point operations per second

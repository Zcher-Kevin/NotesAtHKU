## Hard disk drives

!!! note "Components"

    * **Platter**: A disk that stores data magnetically.
    * **Tracle**: A ring on a platter that stores data.
    * **Sector**: A segment of a track, usually 512 bytes.
    * **Cylinder**: A set of tracks on different platters that are aligned vertically.
    * **Read/write head**: A device that reads and writes data on a platter.

!!! note "Sector format"

    * 30 sectors, 600 bytes each, 512 bytes for data, 88 bytes for control information
    * Sector fields:
        * **Gap 1** (17b): Separates sectors
        * **ID Field** (7b): Contains *Synch* (1b), *Track, head, sector* (4b), *CRC* (2b)
        * **Gap 2** (41b): Separates ID and data field
        * **Data Field** (515b): Contains *Synch* (1b), *Data* (512b), *CRC* (2b)
        * **Gap 3** (40b): Separates data and ID field

!!! note "Disk layout methods"

    There are two methods for laying out data on a disk:

    * **Constant Angular Velocity** (CAV): The disk rotates at a constant speed, and the data is read at a constant rate. Easier read/write, but density of data decreases from inner track to outer tracks, wasting space.
    * **Multiple Zone Recording** (MZR): Divides disk into zones, with each zone having a different number of sectors per track. Data density is nearly constant and allows maximized storage capacity.

!!! tip "Disk Access Time"

    * **Average seek time** $T_\text{seek}$: Time taken to move the read/write head to the desired track.
    * **Average rotational latency** $T_\text{latency}$: Time required for sector to rotate under the head
    * **Data transfer time** $T_\text{transfer}$: Time taken to read or write the data once the head is in position.
    * Time for one rotation $T_\text{rotation}$
    * TIme to rotate one sector $T_\text{sector}$
    * Number of sectors per track $n_\text{sectors}$

    Formulas in seconds: 

    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    & \frac{1}{rps} = \frac{60}{RPM} \\
    & T_\text{rotation} & \frac{1}{rps} \\
    & T_\text{latency} & \frac12 \times T_\text{rotation} \\
    & T_\text{sector} & \frac{T_\text{rotation}}{n_\text{sectors}} \\
    & T_\text{transfer} & \frac{\text{bytes}}{\text{bytes per track}} \times \frac{1}{rps} \\
    \end{aligned}
    ```

    Time to access $n$ **consecutive** sectors ignoring transfer speed is given by $T_\text{seek} + T_\text{latency} + n \times T_\text{sector}$

    Time to access $n$ **non-consecutive** sectors ignoring transfer speed is given by $(T_\text{seek} + T_\text{latency} + T_\text{sector}) \times n$

## Solid State Drives (SSD)

!!! info "SSD"

    * Non-volatile storage devices
    * Limited write cycles
    * Faster I/O, access time than HDDs
    * No moving parts: Lower power consumption, less heat, no noise, high durability

## Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)

The goal of RAID is to improve performance and reliability of data storage by using multiple disks. 


| **RAID Level** | **Data Layout / Parity**                                                                     | **Fault Tolerance**                           | **Advantages**                                                                 | **Disadvantages**                                                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **0**        | Data is striped (distributed in a round-robin fashion) across disks; no parity               | None – one disk failure causes total data loss| Excellent I/O performance; simple design                                       | No redundancy – loss of any disk results in loss of the entire array      |
| **1**        | Data is mirrored on two disks                                                                | Can tolerate disk failure as long as one copy remains | 100% redundancy; potentially reduced seek time during read operations             | Requires double the physical writes; highest storage overhead            |
| **2**        | Data is striped at the bit level with dedicated disks for Error Correction Codes (Hamming codes)| Error correction possible, but requires extra disks | High data transfer rate (especially with smaller strip sizes); simpler ECC controller design compared to later RAID levels | Expensive; high ECC disk-to-data disk ratio; not used commercially         |
| **3**        | Data is striped at the bit level; one dedicated disk stores parity bits                       | Recovers from a single disk failure            | Very high read/write speeds; efficient use of ECC for fault recovery            | Dedicated parity disk can become a bottleneck                           |
| **4**        | Data is striped at the block level with a dedicated parity disk                               | Recovers from a single disk failure            | Allows individual spindle control; similar benefits as RAID 3                 | Write penalty (requiring extra read/write cycles to update parity); uncommon |
| **5**        | Data and parity are distributed across all disks; parity is calculated on a block basis         | Can endure one disk failure                    | High I/O performance; distributed parity avoids single-disk bottlenecks; widely used | More complex parity recalculation; rebuild process can be challenging      |
| **6**        | Similar to RAID 5 but with dual distributed parity (using two different parity methods)         | Tolerates up to two disk failures              | Highest fault tolerance; enhanced data reliability                             | Higher controller complexity and parity computation overhead             |

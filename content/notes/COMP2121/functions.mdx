## Introduction

!!! tip "Definition of functions"

    For non-empty sets $A$ and $B$, a "function $f$ from $A$ to $B$" is a relation from $A$ to $B$ such that for each $a \in A$, there is exactly one $b \in B$ such that $(a, b) \in f$. 
    
    We write $f: A \to B$ to denote that $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$.

!!! info "Terminologies"

    For $f: A \to B, \quad f(a) = b$:

    - **Domain**: $A$
    - **Codomain**: $B$
    - $b$ is the **image** of $a$ under $f$
    - $a$ is a **preimage** of $b$ under $f$
    - The **Range** is the specific set of codomains that were assigned. It is always a **subset** of the codomain.

    - $f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ is a **real-valued function**
    - $f: A \to \mathbb{Z}$ is an **integer-valued function**

!!! tip "Combining functions"

    Combination of functions by addition or multiplication retain the same domain and codomain, i.e. $f_1,f_2: A \to B \implies (f_1 + f_2), (f_1 \cdot f_2): A \to B$

!!! note "Functions of a Subset"

    For $f: A\to B, \quad S \subseteq A$, the **image of S under f** is:

    ```math
    f(S) = \{y\ |\ \exists x \in S, f(x) = y\}
    ```

!!! note "Characteristics of functions"

    | Characteristic | Definition | 
    | --- | --- | 
    | Injection / One-to-one | $f: \mathbb{R},\quad \{(a \lt b) \to (f(a) \lt f(b))\} \lor \{(a \lt b) \to (f(a) \gt f(b))\}$ | 
    | Surjection / Onto | $\forall y \exists x : f(x)=y$ | 
    | Bijection / One-to-one Correspondence | Both one-to-one and onto | 
    | Total | $\forall x \in A \exists y \in B : f(x)=y$ |
    | Partial | Not total |

!!! tip "Inverse functions"

    The inverse function $f^{-1}$ will inverse the mapping: $f(a)=b\to f^{-1}(b) = a$.

    Only **Bijection** function can have an inverse function.

!!! note "Composition of functions"

    The composition of functions $f(g(x))$ can be written as $(f \circ g)(x)$. The order is important.

    The composition of function and its inverse will produce the input: $(f \circ f^{-1})(x) = (f^{-1}\circ f)(x) = x$

## Special functions

!!! note "Ceiling and Floor functions"

    - **Ceiling function**: $\lceil x \rceil = \min\{n \in \mathbb{Z}\ |\ n \geq x\}$ (round up)
    - **Floor function**: $\lfloor x \rfloor = \max\{n \in \mathbb{Z}\ |\ n \leq x\}$ (round down)

!!! note "Other functions"

    You should be familiar with the exponential, logarithmic and factorial functions already.

## Graph of functions

!!! tip "Graph of functions"

    The formal defintion of a graph is:

    ```math
    \text{Graph}(f) = \{(x, f(x))\ |\ x \in A\} \subseteq A \times B
    ```

!!! note "Vertical line test"

    A relation is a function if and only if no vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point.

## Growth of functions

Big O notation simplifies a function to its growth rate in respect to the input size.

!!! tip "Definitions of Big Notation"

    ```math
    T(n) \in A(g(n))\ \text{iff}\ \exists\ c > 0:
    ```
    ```math
    T(n) \simeq c\cdot g(n)\ \forall\ n \geq n_0 > 0
    ```

    | Notation | Condition | Asymptotic boundary | Name |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | $O(g)$ | $T(n) \leq c\cdot g(n)$ | Upper | Big O |
    | $\Omega(g)$ | $T(n) \geq c\cdot g(n)$ | Lower | Big Omega |
    | $\Theta(g)$ | $ c_1\cdot g(n\leq T(n) \leq c_2\cdot g(n)$ | Tight | Big Theta / Order of growth |

!!! note "Identifying growth rates"

    Identify **the term with the highest growth rate** in $T(n)$ would be $g(n)$.

    The following gives the common growth rate functions (increasing order of growth):

    ```math
    1 < \log n < \sqrt{n} < n < n\log n < n^2 < n^3 < 2^n < n! < n^n
    ```
